# Java Best Practices Guide

## 1. Code Organization and Style
- Follow consistent naming conventions
  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`)
  - Methods and variables: camelCase (e.g., `getUserById`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_CONNECTIONS`)
- Keep classes focused and single-purpose (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Limit line length to 80-120 characters for readability
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes

## 2. Performance Optimization
- Use StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops
- Prefer primitive types over wrapper classes when possible
- Use appropriate collection types based on use case
  - ArrayList for fast iteration
  - LinkedList for frequent insertions/deletions
  - HashSet for unique elements and fast lookup
- Avoid creating unnecessary objects

## 3. Exception Handling
- Use specific exceptions instead of generic ones
- Never catch Exception without rethrowing or logging
- Use try-with-resources for automatic resource management
- Include meaningful error messages in exceptions

```java
// Good
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {
    // Process file
} catch (IOException e) {
    logger.error("Failed to read file: " + file.getName(), e);
}

// Bad
try {
    // Some code
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for all public methods
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario
- Keep tests independent and idempotent

## 5. Documentation
- Use Javadoc for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Keep comments meaningful and up-to-date
- Document why, not what (code should be self-documenting)

## 6. Concurrency
- Use higher-level concurrency utilities instead of raw threads
- Prefer immutability when possible
- Be cautious with synchronization to avoid deadlocks
- Use thread pools via ExecutorService for managing threads

## 7. Code Quality
- Use static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, PMD)
- Regularly refactor code to improve maintainability
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use dependency injection to manage object creation and lifecycle

## 8. Memory Management
- Be mindful of memory leaks, especially in long-running applications
- Use weak references when appropriate
- Close resources properly in finally blocks or try-with-resources
- Be cautious with static variables and their lifecycle

## 9. Security
- Validate all user input
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Avoid serialization vulnerabilities
- Keep sensitive data encrypted
- Use secure random number generation when needed

## 10. API Design
- Design APIs to be intuitive and consistent
- Use method overloading judiciously
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Make good use of interfaces for abstraction
